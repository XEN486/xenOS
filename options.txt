    -> Recommended. Should only be disabled for debugging.

NO_PANIC
    -> Disables kernel panics.
    -> Not recommended.

ASSERT_PANIC
    -> Makes assertions panic instead of showing a notification.
    -> Not recommended.

VERBOSE_DEBUG
    -> Adds extra debugging information.
    -> Not recommended, unless you are making changes to the kernel.
